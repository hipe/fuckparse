# Introducing Fuckparse

### _what the world needs now_

Fuckparse is an angry command line processor written in javascript for use in node.js. It started as a stand-in CLI parser until i found something i loved. Now _it_ _is_ the one i love.

This is the eighth command line parser i have worked with and the sixth that have written. [1] Hence I am expert on the topic.

[1]:#comparison

This was written without knowledge of "optparse" by Johan Dahlberg (on npmjs.org), which may very well be "better."

The most important part of a CLI parser is that it have a philosopy. The philosophy of fuckparse is that it be:

  * sufficiently expressive to represent the grammar of your interface.
  * as concise as is reasonable without sacrificing clarity.

## Features

  * concise, readable syntax inspired by ruby's OptionParser (optparse)
  * subcommands
  * colors

## Wishlist / todo / known issues / known limitations

  * api reflection for use in making restful api's, etc.
  * disble colors
  * validations [2]
